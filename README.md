## Deployed to Cloudflare 


This remote MCP server publishes a `tool` for searching and querying the documentation for ATprotocol.

| Tool                   | Description             |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| `search_documentation` | Searches the atproto docs |


Created with love ðŸ’™, to make life easier for developers building on the protocol. 

This remote MCP server is publicly available at: 
```
https://mcp-atproto-docs.immber.workers.dev/sse
```

## Depends on

Created using the [remote MCP authless server template](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/tree/main/demos/remote-mcp-authless) CloudFlare provides. 

This MCP server queries a CloudFlare AutoRAG instance that is fed by a Cloudflare worker with ATprocol's public documentation. 
* cron worker `=>`  R2 storage bucket `=>`  AutoRAG  Vectorize DB
  

This project was originally inspired by [Cloudflare's Documentation MCP Server](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/tree/main/apps/docs-vectorize). 


## Sources

[atproto-docs-worker](https://github.com/immber/atproto-docs-worker) is a cloudflare worker that crawls and saves documentation to an R2 bucket. It runs on a weekly cron schedule.
